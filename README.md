# MultiClipboard Beta v0.0.3: Full Windows Support
MultiClipboard is a custom clipboard that gives you 10 slots to store text and easy keybinds to access them.

This repository contains the source code and app for MultiClipboard on Windows. To get the source code, go to ``windows/src``. To get the application, go to ``windows/app``, unzip, and run.

**Usage**

After running the source code or the app, a terminal-like window should pop up. To start using the clipboard slots, first copy the text you want to add to MultiClipboard normally. Then, hit ``Alt``+``C``+ any number from ``0`` to ``9``. The number will be the clipboard slot that the text is stored at.

To paste text, hit ''Alt'' + ''V'' + the clipboard slot the text is stored at. This will paste the text from MultiClipboard to your normal clipboard. After doing this, paste normally and it should work.
